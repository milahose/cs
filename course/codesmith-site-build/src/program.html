          <p>Codesmith is a center of Software Engineering Excellence, and a selective and tight-knit community of engineers
            you keep for life.</p>
          <p>Codesmith students (known as Residents) have built some of the most prominent tools, used by thousands of developers
            - React Monocle, Reactide, WebDSP and applications deployed at scale - YouDescribe and Veritas Prep Offline.</p>
          <p><img class="img-responsive" src=<%=require( "./images/photo-assets/photo-01.jpg") %> /></p>
          <h3 id="your-background">Your Background</h3>
          <p>Each admitted resident has shown enormous potential in five capacities that make an excellent engineer. Residents
            come from an exceptional and eclectic range of backgrounds from PhDs to software engineers, from Stanford Computer
            Science graduates to self-teachers.</p>

          <h3 id="pedagogy">Pedagogy</h3>
          <p>Residents become engineers, not technicians, through a deep understanding of advanced JavaScript practices, computer
            science (algorithms &amp; data structures), OOP & functional programming. We place analytical problem-solving
            and technical communication at the heart of the program - the most valued capacities of a software engineer.
            The curriculum centers on the most valuable contemporary technologies - React, Redux, Node, build tools, and
            machine learning. </p>
          <p>Students ask the questions "Why?" instead of just the "How?" - Codesmith residents learn how to learn, making them
            lifelong learners and adaptable to the constantly-changing world of technology and software engineering.
          </p>

          <h3 id="career">Career</h3>
          <p>The program focuses on preparing graduates for positions as mid/senior developers with whiteboarding and advanced
            technical interview practice, resume and profiles development, and interview and networking strategies
          </p>
          <p>25% of graduates receive offers for Senior Engineer positions and above, and about 70% receive offers for Mid-level
            Engineer. Graduates are transforming healthcare at Heal and Impact Health, mental health at UCLA, and drone technology
            at Airmap, while others work on large systems at the top technology companies in the country. </p>
          <p>Support continues upon graduation, with bi-weekly check-ins and after offers, negotiation support. Residents also
            participate in postgraduate education in advanced software architecture and Machine Learning (6 week program).</p>
          <p>Graduates have access to a network of hundreds of companies throughout the US with graduates working in LA, SF,
            Seattle, New York, Boston and SD, and in China and the UK.</p>

          <h2 id="core-curriculum" class="page-header">Core Curriculum</h2>

          <h3 id="javascript-principles">JavaScript (ECMAScript Features)</h3>
          <p>Codesmith is about engineering, and Javascript is the vehicle with which we teach it.</p>
          <p>JavaScript became the standard language of the web decades ago, and it has evolved tremendously in terms of popularity
            and power ever since. Today, JavaScript is used to create websites, servers, mobile apps, games, desktop apps,
            and even interactive toasters through the Internet of Things.</p>
          <p><img class="img-responsive" src=<%=require( "./images/photo-pair-programming.jpg") %> /></p>
          <p>JavaScript was designed to deliver incredible user experiences. The language is "event-driven" and built for user
            interaction. It allows applications to respond to clicks, mouse movement, characters typed, internet connection,
            window resizing, and so many other "events" in an intuitive way. </p>
          <p>In addition to its interactivity, JavaScript is meant to be flexible. It is a full-stack language, incorporating
            both frontend and backend technologies, which is a major reason for its appeal. Additionally, if other developers
            use your code in a way you didn't intend, or your users don't interact with the application as expected, JavaScript
            does its best to intelligently figure out what to do instead of immediately throwing errors and breaking the
            application (as happens in many other languages). JavaScript is the go-to language to build an application that
            will interact with real people.</p>

          <p><img class="img-responsive" src=<%=require( "./images/photo-assets/photo-07.jpg") %> /></p>
          <p>Front-end development is the structured application of design and programming to enhance the experience of a user.
            Often seen as the bridge between the designer and the back-end, the front-end is increasingly at the heart of
            the user-experience and, more specifically, how an application feels.</p>
          <p>The number of front-end technologies have skyrocketed over time. Because of this, tools and libraries are constantly
            changing. This has made fundamental principles increasingly important in order to adapt to and anticipate emerging
            technologies.
          </p>
          <p>The goal of the front-end curriculum is to prepare developers to mediate between frameworks by being equally proficient
            in industry-leading technologies as well as front-end principles.</p>
          <p>At the core of the front-end curriculum is responsiveness, performance, and accessibility. Surrounding these principles
            are approaches to DOM manipulation and single page applications. Codesmith residents implement architectural
            patterns such as the model-view-controller and examine design patterns including composition in React and two-way
            data binding in Angular.</p>
          <p><strong>Topics Covered:</strong> Single-page applications and Front-end structure, React, Angular </p>

          <p><img class="img-responsive" src=<%=require( "./images/projects-assets/project-banner-reactide.jpg") %> /></p>

          <p><img class="img-responsive" src=<%=require( "./images/photo-assets/photo-02.jpg") %> /></p>
          <p>Connecting your application to a source of information or business logic is an essential part of the development
            process. To be familiar with how to access back-end data like databases (like SQL or Mongo), or third-party APIs
            (like Google Maps API) is only part of the skillset needed to engineer a well thought-out application.</p>
          <p>Back-end development requires engineering a robust and scalable layer on the web server that interfaces with both
            the client and the back-end data. Server-side controllers that are written properly provide more freedom to engineer
            several different front end views that reflect different needs of different users.
          </p>
          <p>Residents build full-stack projects regularly, and gain practice developing back-end layers that address all real-world
            concerns. Concerns to be addressed in the design of the server controllers often include security, modularity,
            scalability, efficiency and stability.</p>
          <p>Being a layer in between the front-end and the hardware where data is stored, back-end engineers often must work
            with many other departments, such as front-end engineers, DevOps engineers, and DBAs (database administrators).
          </p>
          <p><strong>Topics Covered:</strong> Servers (Node &amp; Express), Databases (MongoDB &amp; SQL), Authentication &amp;
            Authorization </p>

          <p>Many Software Engineers get by with memories of their computer science studies in college, but struggle to bring
            the knowledge to bear on problems they face as engineers.</p>
          <p>Yet a sure footing in computer science, and their core components, algorithms and data structures, enables you
            to successfully build beautiful and efficient software. </p>
          <p>Designing algorithms is a process of achieving increasingly effective ways to solve a problem. Residents develop
            algorithms to solve some of the most prominent challenges in software engineering including sorting, path-finding,
            and searching.</p>
          <p>The efficiency of your algorithm, data structure, and programming paradigm choices can be the difference between
            a product's success or failure. This means:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Choosing and designing algorithms that optimize for time/space complexity trade-offs using Big-O notation
            </li>
            <li>Understanding object-oriented programming principles: inheritance, abstraction and encapsulation and the distinct

          <h2 id="technical-communication">Technical Communication</h2>
          <p>Technical communication is one of the main predictors of success for students at Codesmith as well as software
            engineers in the professional realm. We recognize that coding, at Codesmith and in the software engineering world
            overall, is very rarely an individual endeavor. </p>
          <p><img class="img-responsive" src=<%=require( "./images/photo-assets/photo-04.jpg") %> /></p>
          <p>At Codesmith, residents are consistently working in pairs and small teams, and this makes the ability to clearly,
            accurately communicate ideas, expectations and problems vital. For this reason, developing technical communication
            skills is a principal focus of ours and we achieve this goal in a number of ways:</p>
          <h4 id="pair-programming">Pair Programming</h4>
          <p>The most common method through which we practice technical communication is pair programming, and Codesmith residents
            can expect to spend literally hundreds of hours pairing with others in their cohort. The
            <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zYuwSLrUXw">benefits of pair programming</a> extend beyond an extra
            pair of eyes to find bugs in code. By pairing with a partner you are constantly exposed to new approaches and
            techniques and are challenged to talk through your own code in a way that is clear enough that another person
            can do the typing. In a short time, Codesmith residents truly do talk the talk.</p>

          <h4 id="presentations">Presentations</h4>
          <p>In addition to pairing, technical communication is developed through a number of presentations that all residents
            give during their twelve weeks in the program. Residents give a Tech Talk on a topic of their choice and present
            the projects they create throughout the program. This culminates in our Hiring Week, during which students present
            their final Production Project, and a related Tech Talk, to an audience that includes developers, engineers,
            and representatives from dozens of local companies. By the time students leave Codesmith, they are not only well-prepared
            to build incredible tools, they are able to describe the what, why, and how at a professional level.</p>

          <h2 id="engineering-best-practices">Engineering Best Practices</h2>

          <h3 id="project-management">Project Management</h3>
          <p>Building powerful applications and developer tools requires more than just technical ability. Project management
            is the art and science of planning out projects, monitoring them throughout the development process, and assessing
            their results. Without effective project management, teams are likely to run into many avoidable conflicts in
            the development process.</p>
          <p>Throughout the project phase, Codesmith residents get extensive practice with project management. Starting a new
            project, one of the first steps is to break the project down into many smaller tasks. Residents use scrum boards
            to assign these tasks to team members, track their status, and assess the overall progress made on the project.</p>
          <p><img class="img-responsive" src=<%=require( "./images/photo-assets/photo-05.jpg") %> /></p>
          <p>Because these projects involve multiple people working on different portions of the project, good project management
            places an emphasis on daily standups, a proper Git workflow, and code review. Residents conduct daily standups
            to brief their partners on what they have accomplished and any hurdles they may have in completing their current
            tasks. When a task is completed and ready to be merged with previous code, students employ strategies for minimizing
            conflicts that may slow down production. And before new code is merged, project partners conduct a rigorous review
            to ensure the code is accomplishing what it is intended to do.</p>
          <p>Effective project management takes time and dedication - not only from the project manager - but from all team
            members. However, this effort pays off in end result and in the time it takes to reach it.</p>

          <h4 id="deployment">Deployment</h4>
          <p>When a software product is production ready and has been properly tested to confirm as such, the final step is
            to deploy. Deployment is the process of making a software product available for use.</p>
          <p>The source code must be prepped to show only what the authors of the code are comfortable sharing with the public
            at large. This often means bundling and minifying code to simplify distribution while obscuring code structure.</p>
          <p>Whether the product is a user-facing application or a developer tool, the product must be hosted for distribution.
            Depending on the product, suitable hosts can range from Raspberry Pi to Amazon Web Services. Servers hosting
            deployed products should be fault-tolerant and ready to restart automatically upon encountering runtime errors.
            Protection of the host can also come in many other forms such as proxy servers.</p>
          <p>Codesmith production projects made in the immersive program are very often developer tools and are always deployed
            to the public as open source projects. Residents of the immersive program receive instruction on choosing a proper
            host and preparing documentation to enable other developers to gain familiarity with the API of their tools.</p>

          <h2 id="career-development">Career Development</h2>
          <p>The path to becoming an engineering leader involves more than just technical preparation. Codesmith students begin
            the career development program in-tandem with the production project phase during the senior portion of their
            curriculum. The career development program rounds out the full skill set students need to join powerful, effective
            teams tackling and building interesting things post-graduation.</p>
          <p>Throughout this program, students receive individual guidance from both their peers and the Codesmith team in the
            areas of resume development, interviewing, whiteboarding, online profile development, and application outreach.
            The support continues after a student's cohort ends, with graduates coming back for on-site check-ins and mock
            interviews. Even after landing their first position post-graduation, if graduates are looking to move positions
            or companies in the future, the Codesmith team is always there to provide guidance and support.</p>
          <p>Career development never ends, and once a student, residents are forever a part of a community that will constantly
            push them to be better, to be more impactful, and will support them along the way.</p>

          <h2 id="precourse-and-pre-codesmith">Precourse & Pre-Codesmith</h2>

          <h3 id="precourse">Precourse</h3>
          <p>In the weeks leading up to Codesmith, admitted residents are required to complete precourse assignments designed
            to accelerate their JavaScript growth and learning. The precourse is done remotely through GitHub, with weekly
            office hours for guidance. The precourse introduces residents to the pace of learning at Codesmith, and ensures
            that everyone is ready to dive into the program on Day 1. </p>
          <p>The precourse takes students through basics of CSS and HTML to more advanced JavaScript functionality with Ajax
            and complex parsers.</p>

          <h3 id="jshp-community">JSHP Community</h3>
          <p>Over 90% of admitted students attend our free weekly workshop “<a href="https://www.meetup.com/Build-with-Code-los-angeles/">JavaScript the Hard Parts</a>”
            in preparation for the technical interview. These free workshops, taught by Codesmith Lead Engineers, go under-the-hood
            of concepts that are essential to all successful JavaScript applications.</p>
          <p><img class="img-responsive" src=<%=require( "./images/photo-assets/photo-03.jpg") %> /></p>
          <p>Most importantly, they allow you to immerse yourself in the Codesmith community, improve your technical communication
            and problem solving abilities by pair programming, and meet fellow learners and builders.</p>
          <p>JavaScript the Hard Parts is held every Thursday evening at Codesmith HQ, and streamed worldwide.</p>

          <h3 id="traditions">Traditions</h3>
          <p><img class="img-responsive" src=<%=require( "./images/photo-traditions.png") %> /></p>
          <p>An important aspect of life at Codesmith are the activities that aren’t associated with JavaScript. Staff and students
            bond through relay races, bonfires, camping trips to Joshua Tree, and biweekly breakaway meetings to chat, to
            name a few. Longer lunches incorporate kickball, basketball, and yoga as well as trips to nearby gyms. </p>
          <!-- INSERT PICS from IG - not posed ones + VR Pics -->
          <p>The end of each cohort culminates with a graduation celebration, and alumni are frequently on-site for larger Codesmith
            alumni social events and advanced workshops.</p>

          <h3 id="alumni-community">Alumni Community</h3>
          <p>The Codesmith Alumni Community is a community for life. Codesmith graduates are working everywhere from Los Angeles
            to Boston to Shanghai, and their accomplishments and success continue to grow every day.</p>
          <p><img class="img-responsive" src=<%=require( "./images/photo-assets/photo-06.jpg") %> /></p>
          <p>Codesmith Alumni are able to take advantage of this network of like-minded software engineers via an Alumni Slack
            channel, an Alumni-only workspace at Codesmith HQ, cross-cohort reunions, exclusive invites to new Codesmith
            programs and initiatives (like the <a href="https://www.codesmith.io/blog/machine-learning-program">Machine Learning Beta program</a>),
            and unlimited hiring support throughout the course of their careers. </p>

          <h3 id="admissions">Admissions</h3>
          <p>To apply you must complete a coding challenge and questions about your experience. You may also apply through the
            special challenge available at JavaScript the Hard Parts sessions. If you are successful you will be invited
            to interview for the program.</p>
          <p>The two interviews assess your potential in the five areas that make an exceptional engineer.</p>
          <ol>
            <li>Analytical problem-solving - How do you use code as a tool to reason about about new problems you face in the
              technical interview</li>
            <li>Technical communication - Talking through your code precisely and clearly (a huge part of what makes an effective
              engineer)
            </li>
            <li>Non-technical communication - Will you be thoughtful and supportive of others through the tough hours and work</li>
            <li>How you handle hitting a block - How do you debug, take feedback when you hit a block in your understanding (we
              make sure you hit a moment like this in the interview)</li>
            <li>JavaScript experience - This is surprisingly not the best predictor of growth-rate but is the 5th most important
              factor
            </li>
          </ol>
          <p>The first interview is non-technical, the second is technical. In the technical interview you work through coding
            challenges with an engineer on the team. We're interested in seeing how you tackle problems and communicate your
            ideas. </p>
          <p>We realize that the Codesmith admissions process can feel intimidating but we have created numerous free public
            classes to help you prepare - you can find them all <a href="https://www.meetup.com/build-with-code-los-angeles/">here</a>.</p>
