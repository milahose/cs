## What are Hack Hours?
Hack hours are a series of algorithm problems to refine your problem solving skills. You will be presented a new algorithm problem every day starting after the algorithm unit.

## What do I do after I complete a Hack Hour problem?
After you complete a hack hour problem, please make a pull request to the branch named after your username under the CodesmithLLC organization. Within a few minutes, you will receive an autogenerated email indicating whether your solution passed our series of tests.

## How do I test Ruby files?
Some later hack hours include Ruby files (.rb) as well as a JS file. For these hack hours you should attept to complete both the JS and the Ruby versions. The tests for Ruby are included in the .rb file. In order to test your work, you'll need to do the following:
- [ ] [Install Ruby](https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/documentation/installation/)
- [ ] run `gem install test-unit` from your hack-hour directory
- [ ] run `ruby challenges/challenge-name.rb`
